## EMNLP '23: Learning Co-Speech Gesture for Multimodal Aphasia Type Detection 
This codebase contains the python scripts for the model for the EMNLP 2023. https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.577/

## Environment & Installation Steps
Python 3.8 & Pytorch 1.12

### pytorch & dgl installation
```
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1+cu113 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install torchmetrics==1.4.2
pip install dgl==1.0.2 -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/cu113/repo.html
```

## Run
Execute the following steps in the same environment:
```
cd Multimodal-Aphasia-Type-Detection_EMNLP_2023 & python main.py
```

## Dataset
- `dataset_chunk50_sample.json`: Due to ethical concerns, we can only provide a sample dataframe consisting of ASR transcripts and labels.

## Ethical Concerns
We sourced the dataset from AphasiaBank with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (SKKU2022-11-039) and strictly follow the data sharing guidelines provided by [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/share/ethics.html), including the Ground Rules for all TalkBank databases based on American Psychological Association Code of Ethics (Association et al., 2002). Additionally, our research adheres to the five core issues outlined by TalkBank in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation, 2018). These issues include addressing commercial purposes, handling scientific data, obtaining informed consent, ensuring deidentification, and maintaining a code of conduct. Considering ethical concerns, we did not use any photographs and personal information of the participants from the AphasiaBank.
